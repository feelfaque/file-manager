This is a Node.js file manager app.
You can read the description of the app here: https://github.com/AlreadyBored/nodejs-assignments/blob/main/assignments/file-manager/assignment.md.

NB: If the names of your directories or files include backspaces (" ") please write the paths in brackets for the correct work of the manager ('' or "").
Example: cp "/Users/user 1/my files/text file.txt" "/Users/user 1/new files/new file.txt"

If your command contains 2 paths (e.g. original and destination) use ONE type of brackets on both paths.
